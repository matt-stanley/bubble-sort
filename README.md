Bubble Sort project.

Create a method which sorts an array using bubble sort.

I will optimize by ignoring the last n elements, where n is the number of compelted passes.

My method will also keep track of whether or not a swap has been made during the current iteration. If not, the sort is complete, and the array can be returned.
